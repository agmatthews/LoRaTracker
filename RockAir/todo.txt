GPS
---

motion activated power / sleep on GPS - include button interrupt - see fast rate etc
Use smart beaconing to detect corners and send special messages etc

change reporting rate depending on movement
min_rate = 120 seconds
norm_rate = 5 seconds
fast_rate = 1 second

no movement for > x minutes = min_rate
moved in last x minutes = norm_rate
fast event trigger occured in last y seconds = fast_rate
add taxi / takeoff / landing event detection
include manual button switch to normal (click) / fast (double click)

allow changing of config / parameters via web server
allow viewing of status / map via web server
Set all parameters via web display and store them in flash/SD between boots

check if reading battery can interfere with GPS if occurs at same time as GPS data on I2C bus

why do we get bad GPS data?
detect it and eliminate it

BASE
----
record and send statistics / display on web page
use logging module for debug printing... and Logging
create a debug print function instead of lots of print statements
send more events to TracPlus
define better compression / packing of data - msgpack or similar
send bread crumbs in messages
include breadcrumb in packing
log debug to SD card

crc check fails on 3 digit checksums

Result CRC value: 0x559

example Lora stats

DONE
====
--GPS needs to start webserver
--put a switch on battery lead
--find good rgb library and use it to better display LED as 'sleeping etc'
--Base needs to fail network connection gracefully and allow multiple networks to be defined - incl iphone
--getGPS fails on second call
--change way we import crc library to match GPS code
--fix issue where second time use of getGPS does not works
--fix issue where internet is required or Mqtt fails etc
--allow multi wlan configuration
--allow fall back to switching to WLAN AP works when internet not available
--switch to crc16 for lora transmission
--put crc on start of message
--remove delimeters on message
--allow message to be json
--set up web server on gps unit
--Webserver not serving SD card files on BASE
--log files need to auto increment file name /number on start up
